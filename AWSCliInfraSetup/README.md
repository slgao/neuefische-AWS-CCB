Task: Build a Secure AWS Infrastructure using the CLI

Hey team! 👋
Your next mission is to create a secure AWS infrastructure using the AWS CLI. Follow the steps carefully and remember: write a little, test a little! 🐢⚙️

🔧 Infrastructure Requirements:,

    VPC:
        Must support at least 50 Private IPs and 10 Public IPs.,
        Choose a suitable CIDR block and create subnets accordingly (public & private).,
    ,

    EC2 Instances:
        1 Public Instance with internet access.,
        1 Private Instance that must be able to get updates via NAT or a similar solution.,
        Both instances should allow SSH access for maintenance.,
        Install the latest system updates as part of the launch process.,
    ,

🔐 Security Best Practices:,

    Implement the security best practices you've learned so far.
    Think about what makes your infrastructure secure — and apply that knowledge! 💡,


---

💾 Version Control:,

    Set up a GitHub repository with a fitting name (e.g., aws-cli-infra-setup).,
    Use Git to track your progress — commit your changes frequently and push to GitHub.,


---

📄 Documentation:,
To follow along and ensure the project is reproducible, please:

    Create a README.md or equivalent documentation file.,
    Describe:
        What the project is about,
        What it provides,
        How to clone and launch it in other AWS environments,
    ,

** what does the tool do?
AWS CodeDeploy is a fully managed deployment service that automates application deployments to compute services such as Amazon EC2,
Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS), AWS Lambda, or on-premises servers.
CodeDeploy integrates with other AWS services like CodePipeline and CodeBuild to form a complete CI/CD pipeline, allowing developers to deploy code changes reliably and at scale.

** Why is that an important need?
- Automated software deployment addresses critical needs in modern software development:

    - Speed and Efficiency:
      Manual deployments are slow and error-prone, especially for large-scale or frequent releases. CodeDeploy automates the process, reducing deployment time and human error.
    - Reliability and Consistency:
      It ensures consistent deployment across multiple environments (development, staging, production), minimizing configuration drift and deployment failures.
    - Scalability:
      As applications grow, managing deployments across numerous servers or regions becomes complex. CodeDeploy scales effortlessly, particularly in AWS environments.
    - Reduced Downtime:
      Features like blue/green deployments allow updates without interrupting user access, critical for high-availability applications.
    - Cost Efficiency:
      By automating deployments and reducing errors, it lowers operational costs and developer overhead, especially for organizations leveraging AWS infrastructure.

** Identify specific use cases for the tool.
    - For example, CodeDeploy automates the deployment of updated application code to EC2 instance using some kind of strategies.
    - CodeDeploy manages blue/green deployments for ECS containers, spinning up new container tasks with updated code and switching traffic only after validation, ensuring high availability.

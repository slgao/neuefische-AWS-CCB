** What are some deployment automation tools?

*** What is deployment automation
Deployment automation uses software tools and systems to move code changes from one
software environment to another, eliminating the need for manual software releases.

The system can automatically build, package, test, and release new code merges to staging servers. 

Deployment automation differs from build automation, which concentrates on assembling software components.
Instead, deployment automation focuses on distributing those components to designated environments.

Tools:

- Jenkins, Github Actions, AWS CodeDeploy
- Ansible: Configuration management and deployment tool. Terraform: Provision and deploy infrastructure across cloud providers.
- Docker + Kubernetes: Microservice deployment



** What are the expected benefits of deployment automation?

- Faster release cycles:
  

- Reduced errors:
  Through automation reduce human errors

- Reliability and consistency improvement


- Enhance scalability


- Reduce downtime


- Easier rollbacks


** What are the challenges?

- Initial Setup Complexity

  Creating reliable deployment pipelines and writing scripts for various environments can
  be time-consuming and complex.

- Tool Integration Issues

  Integrating automation tools with existing tools (e.g., version control, cloud services, testing frameworks)
  may require customization.

- Security Risks

  Automated systems, if not properly secured, could be exploited to access
  production environments or sensitive data.

- Over-automation Risks
  
  Automating everything too quickly, without understanding the full process, can
  lead to fragile systems that are hard to maintain.

- Infrastructure Dependency
  
  Automation scripts might depend on specific infrastructure, which can make them less portable or harder to scale.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The application follows a modern N-Tier architecture with event-driven processing:

### Frontend Layer (Presentation Tier)
- Lightweight HTML/CSS/JavaScript interface hosted on EC2 instances
- Drag-and-drop image upload functionality
- Real-time image gallery with processing status indicators
- Visual bounding box display for detected people and faces
- Auto-scaling group across multiple availability zones for high availability
- Application Load Balancer for traffic distribution

### API Layer (Application Tier)
- Python Flask API for backend processing
- RESTful endpoints for image upload and retrieval
- Integration with AWS S3 for image storage
- Nginx proxy for routing requests
- Presigned URL generation for secure image access

### Content Delivery Layer (HTTPS Security)

- Redirects HTTP requests to HTTPS automatically
- Global content delivery with edge location caching
- Built-in DDoS protection with AWS Shield Standard

### Processing Layer (Event-Driven Tier)
- Amazon S3 event notifications trigger SNS topics
- SNS topic acts as a publisher for the event-driven architecture
- AWS Lambda functions subscribe to SNS topics
- Lambda integrates with AWS Rekognition for image analysis
- Decoupled processing ensures scalability and fault tolerance

### Data Layer (Persistence Tier)
- Amazon RDS MySQL database for storing detection results
- Multi-AZ deployment for high availability
- Tables for images, detections, faces, and processing logs
- Amazon S3 for durable image storage with lifecycle policies

## üîÑ System Workflow

1. **Image Upload**: User uploads an image through the frontend interface (via HTTPS)
2. **Storage**: Frontend API stores the image in an S3 bucket
3. **Event Notification**: S3 triggers an event notification to an SNS topic
4. **Processing**: Lambda function subscribed to the SNS topic processes the image
5. **Image Analysis**: Lambda uses AWS Rekognition to detect people and faces
6. **Data Storage**: Detection results are stored in the RDS database
7. **Status Update**: Frontend periodically checks for processing status
8. **Visualization**: Processed images are displayed with bounding boxes and detection data

## üí™ Advantages of This Architecture

### Scalability
- **Decoupled Components**: Each tier can scale independently based on demand
- **Serverless Processing**: Lambda functions automatically scale with the number of image uploads
- **Auto-scaling Frontend**: EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling Group adjust to user traffic
- **Elastic Database**: RDS can be scaled vertically or with read replicas for higher throughput

### Reliability
- **Multi-AZ Deployment**: Components deployed across multiple availability zones
- **Event-Driven Design**: SNS ensures messages are delivered at least once
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Frontend doesn't wait for image processing to complete
- **Smart Refresh System**: Frontend intelligently polls for updates without overwhelming the backend

### Performance
- **Lightweight Frontend**: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS minimizes resource usage
- **Optimized Image Processing**: Lambda functions process images in parallel
- **Efficient Data Storage**: Only relevant detection data is stored in the database
- **Content Delivery**: Images served via presigned URLs for secure, fast access

### Security
- **Private Subnets**: RDS and application components in private subnets
- **Bastion Host**: Secure administrative access to the environment
- **IAM Roles**: Least privilege access for all components
- **Presigned URLs**: Temporary, secure access to S3 objects
- **Security Groups**: Tight network controls between components

### Cost Efficiency
- **Pay-per-use Lambda**: Only pay for actual image processing time
- **Auto-scaling**: Resources scale down during low demand periods
- **S3 Lifecycle Policies**: Automatically manage storage costs for older images
- **Spot Instances**: Option to use spot instances for cost savings in non-critical components

### Maintainability
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Entire environment defined in Terraform
- **Modular Design**: Components can be updated independently
- **Centralized Logging**: CloudWatch logs for all components
- **Monitoring**: Built-in health checks and performance metrics

## üöÄ Deployment Instructions for AWS Sandbox Environment

### Prerequisites

- AWS account with appropriate permissions
- AWS CLI installed and configured
- Terraform installed (v1.0+)
- Git installed

### Sandbox Lab Environment IAM Configuration

This project is configured specifically for AWS Sandbox Lab environments:

- The Lambda function uses the existing **'LabRole'** IAM role, which has the necessary permissions for S3, Rekognition, and RDS access
- Frontend EC2 instances have the **'LabInstanceProfile'** attached, allowing them to access the S3 bucket for image uploads
- No additional IAM roles or policies need to be created, simplifying deployment in the lab environment

### Important S3 Bucket Configuration

In AWS Sandbox Lab environments:

- The S3 bucket must be created manually **before** running Terraform
- Terraform code references this pre-existing S3 bucket rather than creating it
- This approach is necessary because the lab environment has disabled object lock functionality
- If Terraform attempts to create the S3 bucket resource directly, it will check for object lock capabilities and throw an error
- Manual bucket creation bypasses this check and allows the deployment to proceed successfully

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/n-tier-detection-system.git
cd n-tier-detection-system
```

### Step 2: Create EC2 Key Pair

```bash
# Create a key pair for EC2 instances
aws ec2 create-key-pair --key-name detection-system-key --query 'KeyMaterial' --output text > detection-system-key.pem
chmod 400 detection-system-key.pem
```

### Step 3: Create S3 Bucket for Image Storage

```bash
# Create a unique S3 bucket for image storage
aws s3 mb s3://detection-system-images-$(date +%s)
```

### Step 4: Prepare Lambda Function Package

The Lambda function requires a deployment package with all necessary dependencies. Use the provided script to create it:

```bash
# Navigate to the Lambda function directory
cd modules/lambda_rekognition

# Make the script executable
chmod +x create_compatible_package.sh

# Run the script to create the Lambda deployment package
./create_compatible_package.sh

# Return to the project root directory
cd ../..
```

This script will:
- Install required dependencies with Linux compatibility
- Package everything into a zip file ready for Lambda deployment
- Handle platform-specific requirements for cryptography libraries
- Verify the package contents

### Step 5: Configure Terraform Variables

Create a `terraform.tfvars` file with your specific values:

```hcl
region = "us-west-2"
key_name = "detection-system-key"
s3_bucket_name = "detection-system-images-1234567890"  # Use your bucket name
db_password = "YourSecurePassword123!"
```

### Step 5: Deploy the application

```bash
# Run the deployment bash script
./deploy.sh
```

### Step 6: Access the Application

After successful deployment, you can access the application using two URLs:

```bash
# Get the ALB DNS name (HTTP)
terraform output alb_dns_name

# Get the CloudFront HTTPS URL
terraform output cloudfront_https_url
```

Open the CloudFront HTTPS URL in your web browser to access the N-Tier Detection System securely.

**Note**: CloudFront distribution deployment may take 15-30 minutes to complete. During this time, the HTTPS URL may not be immediately available.

### Administrative Access

To access the system via the bastion host:

```bash
# Connect to bastion host
ssh -i detection-system-key.pem ec2-user@<bastion-public-ip>

# From bastion, connect to frontend instances
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa ec2-user@<frontend-private-ip>
```

## üîç Technical Details

### Frontend Implementation

The frontend is built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for optimal performance:

- **Drag-and-drop upload** using the HTML5 File API
- **Real-time status updates** with smart refresh system
- **Responsive design** for mobile and desktop
- **Bounding box visualization** with hover effects
- **Modal view** for detailed image analysis
- **Special highlighting** for faces detected outside person bounding boxes

### Backend Implementation

The backend uses Python Flask with the following components:

- **RESTful API endpoints** for image operations
- **S3 integration** for secure image storage
- **Database connection pooling** for efficient RDS access
- **Presigned URL generation** for secure image retrieval
- **Health check endpoints** for load balancer integration
- **Nginx proxy** for routing and load balancing

### Lambda Processing

The Lambda function performs the following tasks:

- **Image retrieval** from S3 upon SNS notification
- **Rekognition API calls** for detecting people and faces
- **Metadata extraction** including confidence scores and attributes
- **Database updates** with detection results
- **Error handling** with automatic retries for transient failures
- **CloudWatch logging** for monitoring and debugging

### Database Schema

The database includes the following tables:

- `images`: Stores metadata about uploaded images
- `image_labels`: Stores labels detected in images
- `person_detections`: Stores information about detected persons
- `face_detections`: Stores information about detected faces
- `emotion_detections`: Stores emotional analysis data from detected faces
- `processing_logs`: Stores logs of the processing pipeline

## üõ†Ô∏è Maintenance and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Image Processing Fails

If image processing fails, check:
- S3 bucket permissions
- Lambda function logs
- SNS topic delivery status
- RDS database connectivity

#### Frontend Not Loading

If the frontend doesn't load, check:
- ALB health checks
- EC2 instance status

- Processing time depends on image complexity and size
- The auto-scaling group adjusts capacity based on demand
- Lambda concurrency limits may need adjustment for high-volume scenarios
- Database performance may degrade with very large datasets

## üîí Security Considerations

- All S3 buckets are configured with appropriate access policies
- RDS database is deployed in private subnets
- EC2 instances use security groups with least privilege
- HTTPS is enforced for all communications
- Bastion host provides secure administrative access
- IAM roles follow the principle of least privilege
- Sensitive data is never exposed in logs or responses

## üíæ Backup Recommendations

The current system doesn't include backup solutions. Here are simple recommendations for future implementation:

### RDS Database Backups
- Enable automated daily backups with 7-day retention
- Create weekly manual snapshots for longer-term storage
- Consider cross-region snapshot copying for disaster recovery

### S3 Bucket Backups
- Enable bucket versioning to protect against accidental deletions
- Set up cross-region replication to a secondary region
- Implement lifecycle policies to manage storage costs

### AWS Backup Integration
- Use AWS Backup for centralized backup management
- Create a simple backup plan with daily and monthly schedules
- Include both RDS and S3 resources in the backup plan

These backup solutions will improve system resilience and provide recovery options in case of data loss.
